## My process

### Built with

-  Semantic HTML5 markup
-  CSS custom properties
-  Flexbox

### What I learned

just like the first project it was more of a reminder than a learning experience

i like my semantic tho, of course i should try to learn what is good pratice in semantic but i guess a lot a companies have their own so i have mine

### Continued development

Maybe i'll add some minor animation on hovering to have a smoother look

### Useful resources

-  [Flexbox documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/fr/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_flexible_box_layout/Basic_concepts_of_flexbox) - always good to have this
